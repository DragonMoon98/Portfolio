        <p>Currently focusing on creating content that matters by utilizing my skills in HTML/CSS/Javascript, allowing me to bring my ideas to life. With time, the skill ceiling will be improved and much more refined products will be made.
        </p>
        <p>As of now the content i produce isnt anything grand, as i only recently have picked up HTML studies. Therefor its a journey that i can monitor and document in this website.</p>
        <p>My plans currently for website development involve advancing my business ideas and use it for advertisement and platform creation. One day i will be able to reach my full potential if i keep studying and practicing.</p>
